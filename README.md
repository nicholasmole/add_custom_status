# add_custom_status

Add and edit Custom Status for posts

## What is it used for 

Create more statuses to a post besides Draft, and Published.

Currently the system has server $customLabels arrays that need 
to be altered manually to add more types. 

Also the system is on both Posts and Pages - 
however everything should copy over no problem.
